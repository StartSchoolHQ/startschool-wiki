# My Green Wordpress

Your goal is to build a realistic, professional-looking demo site that demonstrates your ability to use WordPress effectively.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Show that you understand **WordPress basics**.
- Apply **basic SEO** practices. Your website will be evaluated using Google PageRank-like test.
- Make the site look **professional and realistic**. Produce multiple pages, a navigation menu with at least 4 internal links, layout, and styling.

## 📝 Task Requirements

1. **Required Project Structure**: Your submitted repository must follow this structure

    ```
    PROJECT/
    ├── wordpress_url.txt       # Contains only your WordPress site URL, nothing else
    ├── wordpress/              # Folder
    │   └── site-export.xml     # Your exported WordPress content
    └── README.md               # Readme file
    ```

2. **Export from WordPress**: Go to Dashboard → Tools → Export and click Export All Content to download your site’s XML file.
3. **Git**: Run `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
4. **Verify visibility**: Gandalf cannot read your website unless [site privacy](https://wordpress.com/support/privacy-settings/) is set to **Public**.
5. **Gandalf Testing**: Remember to run Gandalf tests and carefully read error messages if any appear.

## 💡 Advice for completing the task

WordPress.com sometimes delays updates, so don’t panic if Gandalf tests fail at first.
If you know your site is correct, simply run the tests again later.
