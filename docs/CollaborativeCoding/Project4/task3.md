Transform your functional API integration into a visually stunning application. This session focuses on creativity, design polish, and having fun with styling technologies.

**Technology choice is yours: pure CSS, SCSS, or try implementing Tailwind. Pick what excites your team most.**

## Possible deliverables

### 1. Visual design system

Create a cohesive design that includes:
- Consistent color palette (primary, secondary, accent colors)
- Typography hierarchy (headings, body text, captions)
- Spacing system (margins, padding, gaps)
- Interactive states (hover, active, focus, disabled)

### 2. Enhanced user experience

Polish the interface with:
- Smooth transitions and animations (loading states, content appearing)
- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Micro-interactions (button clicks, hover effects, form interactions)
- Working across modern browsers

### 3. Creative touches

Add personality to your project:
- Custom loading animation (not a spinner)
- Cool error messages
- Themed styling that matches your API content


## Bonus tasks

- CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theme management
- No inline styles - everything in stylesheets (exception for Tailwind utility classes)
- Performance optimization (critical CSS, lazy loading)

## Team presentation

Prepare a 2-minute demo highlighting:
- Your design decisions and inspiration
- Feature you're most proud of
- One styling trick you learned
