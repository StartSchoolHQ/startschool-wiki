# JavaScript Fundamentals – Practice Tasks

These short tasks are designed to train core JavaScript fundamentals:
- variables
- data types
- if / else statements
- loops

Do not use advanced methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.).  
Focus on clarity and understanding.

---

## Level 1: Variables & Data Types

### Task 1: Age Check
Create a variable `age`.
If `age` is 18 or more, print `"Adult"`, otherwise print `"Minor"`.

---

### Task 2: String Length
Create a variable `username`.
Print how many characters the string contains.

---

### Task 3: Type Detector
Create a variable with any value.
Print the data type of the variable.

---

### Task 4: Temperature Converter
Create a variable `celsius`.
Convert it to Fahrenheit and print the result.

Formula:
F = C * 9/5 + 32

---

## Level 2: If / Else Logic

### Task 5: Even or Odd
Create a variable `number`.
Print `"Even"` if the number is even, otherwise print `"Odd"`.

---

### Task 6: Password Length
Create a variable `password`.
If its length is less than 8, print `"Too short"`.
Otherwise, print `"Password accepted"`.

---

### Task 7: Number Sign
Given a number:
- print `"Positive"` if greater than 0
- print `"Negative"` if less than 0
- print `"Zero"` if equal to 0

---

### Task 8: Grade Evaluator
Given a number from 0 to 100:
- 90–100 → `"A"`
- 80–89 → `"B"`
- 70–79 → `"C"`
- below 70 → `"F"`

---

## Level 3: Loops

### Task 9: Count to 10
Use a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

---

### Task 10: Sum of Numbers
Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop.
Print the result.

---

### Task 11: Multiplication Table
Given a number, print its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

---

### Task 12: Countdown
Given a number, use a loop to count down to 0.

---

## Level 4: Loops + Conditions

### Task 13: Print Even Numbers
Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.

---

### Task 14: Find the Largest Number
Given an array of numbers, find and print the largest number.
Do not use `Math.max`.

---

### Task 15: Divisible by 3
Loop through numbers from 1 to 30.
Print only the numbers divisible by 3.

---

### Task 16: Password Strength Checker
Given an array of passwords:
- print `"Weak"` if the password length is less than 8
- print `"Strong"` otherwise

---

## Level 5: Thinking with Fundamentals

### Task 17: Reverse a String
Given a string, reverse it using a loop and print the result.

---

### Task 18: Count Vowels
Given a string, count how many vowels it contains.
Print the total count.

---

### Task 19: FizzBuzz
Print numbers from 1 to 50:
- `"Fizz"` if divisible by 3
- `"Buzz"` if divisible by 5
- `"FizzBuzz"` if divisible by both

---

### Task 20: Simple Login System
Create predefined `correctUsername` and `correctPassword`.

Given input `username` and `password`:
- print `"Login successful"` if both match
- otherwise print `"Access denied"`

---

## Practice Tips

- Write each solution from scratch
- Avoid copying previous code
- Use `console.log` to inspect values
- Say out loud what each line does

Mastery comes from repetition and clarity.
