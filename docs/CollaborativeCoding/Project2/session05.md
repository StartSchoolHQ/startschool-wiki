# Session 5&6 | JavaScript & Game Logic

## Title: The Quiz Brain

### What to Build
Teams bring their quiz to life with JavaScript logic:

- Store the answers in an [array/](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp)[object](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp).  
- Add [event](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp) handling: when the user clicks **“Submit”**, JS checks the answers.  
- Use [if/else or switch](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conditionals.asp) statements to calculate a score or personality outcome.  
- Display results in the [results area](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref//prop_html_innerhtml.asp).  

Example:  
*“You’re a Carrot: bright, crunchy, and full of energy!”*

---

### Skills Covered
- Arrays/objects for storing quiz questions/answers  
- Event listeners (`addEventListener`) for the button  
- If/else or switch statements for logic  
- DOM manipulation (`document.querySelector`, `.innerText`)  

---

### Outcome
By the end of **Session 6**, each team has a **fully working multiple-choice quiz game** that gives feedback and a playful *“vegetable personality”* result.
