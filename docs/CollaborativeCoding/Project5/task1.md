## Overview

The goal is to build a single high-impact one-page website that feels like a premium brand teaser or campaign drop, inspired by experimental sites such as [damngoodbrands.com.](https://damngoodbrands.com/)

The project focuses on:

* Visual design and motion
* Creative coding

No complex backend or multiple sections are required. One page. One concept. One strong vibe.

---

## Concept: The Brand Teaser Page

Build a one-page experimental website for a fictional brand or product.

The page contains:

* At least one bold hero headline
* A short manifesto or campaign text (3–6 lines)
* At least one call-to-action button
* A cinematic background and a creative use of images

The result should feel like:

* A premium landing page
* A digital poster
* A brand teaser or campaign preview

---

## Live Session Flow

### 1. Collective Creative Direction

* Brand name (one to two words)
* Product category (e.g. coffee, fashion, AI tool, skincare)
* One adjective describing the vibe (e.g. cinematic, brutal, soft, luxury)

Example:

* Brand name: NOVA
* Category: AI camera
* Vibe: cinematic

This defines the entire website.

---

### 2. Vibe Coding

Build the page together!

Core elements to code:

* Full-screen hero layout
* Large typography headline
* Short manifesto text block
* Some buttons (e.g. “Play the teaser”)

Collaborative decisions:

* Headline wording
* Font choice
* Background color or gradient
* Button label
* Subtle motion and transitions

Focus areas:

* Layout and spacing
* Typography hierarchy
* Simple animations (fade in, slide, hover effects)


---

## Technical Setup

### Frontend (main focus)

Recommended stack:

* React (or plain HTML + CSS)
* Optional: Framer Motion or simple CSS transitions


No routing, no forms, no database required.

---

## Final Deliverable

At the end of the session, you will have:

* One live-built teaser website
* A shareable link or demo page
