# Minimal Season 03 Requirements per Specialization

This document defines the **minimum required workload** for each Season 03 specialization at StartSchool.

The goal is to ensure **fairness across tracks** by aligning expectations around:
- Time-on-task  
- Conceptual depth  
- Engineering maturity  

While projects differ in nature, all minimum requirements are balanced to represent a comparable level of effort and foundational competence.  
  
**Completing additional projects beyond the minimum is encouraged and strengthens a student’s portfolio.**

## Notes

- Minimum requirements represent the **baseline expected completion** for Season 03.
- Advanced, capstone, or infrastructure-heavy projects are intentionally **excluded from the minimum**.
- All tracks are designed to be **different in focus, not different in workload**.
- Completing additional projects beyond the minimum is encouraged and strengthens a student’s portfolio.
