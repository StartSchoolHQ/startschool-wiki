# StartSchool logic game competition

We're launching an open competition to create a StartSchool-branded logic game. It will be used at events to spark curiosity and has the potential to replace the Qwasar logic game in our admission process.
___

## The challenge

Build an interactive game similar to [the one you already know](https://logic-game.qwasar.io/index.html) that teaches programming concepts in an engaging, abstract way. But do not make the process too obvious, it should stay as a game that the player has to figure out on their own.

**Prize:** 300 EUR to the winning individual/team  
**Deadline:** January 12, 2026  
**Format:** Individual or team submissions accepted  
**Submission:** Please submit your work [here](https://rigatechgirls.typeform.com/spaceship)
