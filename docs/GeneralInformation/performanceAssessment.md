## Performance review criteria

Your progress is evaluated based on three main factors:

**1. Tech module timeline and individual progress**  
**2. Attendance**  
**3. Overall study process involvement**  


### 1. Tech module timeline and individual progress

**Following the [timeline](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r9_QQkP7pd4Xv5lOkPxzlIvH_4Crf4Qw/view?usp=drive_link)**.

The Tech Module timeline is designed based on our program experience. We encourage you to follow it as closely as possible to get the most out of the learning experience.

**Flexibility**

We understand that everyone learns at a different pace. A variance of Â±1 week is completely acceptable as long as you're making constant progress.

**Factors we consider for timeline flexibility:**
- Illness
- Other excused absences
- Individual learning pace and ability to progress

**Important reminder:** Timeline adherence is just one component of your overall evaluation, not the only factor.
