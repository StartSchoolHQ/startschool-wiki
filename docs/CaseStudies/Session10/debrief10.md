## **On the waterfall vs. agile approach**

In general, it seems that they are working in a "waterfall" way where there are some large list of requirements (probably also not defined precisely as there are a lot of unknowns) but management requires precise deadlines. As requirements are not clear then engineers can't give any precise estimates and then these vague 4-6 week estimates appear.

Instead of this, it would be recommended to work in an "agile" way:
* Prioritize the backlog of small items and work from the top of the list
* Each iteration (which should be no more than couple weeks) produce some working solution
* Then continue with next priorities
* After each iteration there is something more working and then it's the business decision when it is good enough to ship

## **On meetings and status updates**

Meetings are not the only and best approach to do status updates. Engineers hate meetings and will try to avoid them and will not talk about the real technical problems. Meetings are also very expensive when there are a lot of people attending.

Better implement visibility of the project progress which everyone involved can see by themselves:
* Track the status of project backlog items
* Show the burndown / burnup charts of work remaining / work done and how it is progressing
* Write regular status update posts or record videos or record demos of work done that everyone interested could see without holding a meeting

## **On roles and responsibilities**

Tom as a project manager should:
* Discuss with Julie what things are blocking her team and how to remove these blockers
* Work on prioritizing the backlog from the business side
* Handle the communication with top-management

Julie should:
* Discuss the technical issues and blockers with her team
* Help to focus on one task at a time instead of working in parallel on too many things or avoiding going too deep in "rabbit holes" of new ideas or problems
