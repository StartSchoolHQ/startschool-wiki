# When tech meets business

---

## **The story**

Julie is a senior (8 years) engineer at Microsoft. She leads a team building a new cloud storage product that will make data access much faster. Julie has 6 engineers in her team, and there are 3 other teams working on different parts of the solution.

This project is very important, it could bring in $200 million per year if it works.

Tom is the project manager of 5 years. He has managed software projects before, but he doesn't understand the technical details of what Julie's team is building. His job is to track progress and report to management. He has recently joined Microsoft and has yet to prove his competence

Sarah is the engineering manager, Julie's boss. She understands both technical work and business needs and manages 4 high-priority projects across the company.

Executive Stakeholder Committee - Includes the Head of Cloud Services, Head of Product Strategy, and Finance Director. They meet bi-weekly and expect detailed progress reports with specific timelines and risk assessments.

## **The situation**

During their third week of the project, Tom scheduled a "timeline alignment meeting" with Julie to get a clear timeline he can share with non-technical departments. The conversation went as follows:

* Julie, I need definitive timelines for your team's deliverables. The executive committee is asking pointed questions, and I can't keep saying that 'it's complex.'
* Tom, we're building something completely new. We have three different ways we could solve this problem, we won't know which one works until we test each for 4-6 weeks. Even then, building the final thing can take very different amounts of time depending on which approach works.
* Could you please give the slowest estimate? Other teams are waiting for your work and Finance needs to plan the budget. As a company, we cannot work without a timeline

Julie still can't give exact dates, Tom goes to Sarah. Sarah agrees with Julie that the timeline is uncertain, but she also understands the business pressure. She's too busy with other projects, so she hops on a different call and leaves Tom.

Tom sends an email to the entire project team (cc'ing executives) stating: "Due to engineering uncertainties, I'm implementing daily stand-ups and bi-daily progress reports until we achieve timeline clarity."

Julie, feeling micromanaged and professionally undermined, decided to send Tom a detailed project plan with specific dates, knowing internally that the estimates were largely fictional but would make him leave her alone
