## Part 2: What can be learned 

According to the founder, the core of base44 success was high quality product and his “build in public” approach  

In your groups, discuss:  

Have any of you publicly shared what you’re building in StartSchool? Why?  

How incentivised are your current users / leads to share your product / landing page? Do you have a waitlist?  

What is the first marketing channel your team is going to use and why?  

How are you going to collect user feedback fast?  

## Part 3: Put the lesson to practise

Each group member needs to draft a LinkedIn post about their current product / progress within the startup module and make a pledge for when you are going to post it. For example: “I'm going to post this in mid March when launch an update and a waitlist”
