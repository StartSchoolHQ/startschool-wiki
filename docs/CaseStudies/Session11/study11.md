## Task requirements

Select one product that your team would be eager to implement. Create a one-page document in **[this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12UmcIAr0xWC2QU6kt9xRMyYvKqoALtw9)**, using your team members' names in the filename (example: `maria-janis.filetype`).

Time allocation: 50 minutes

## Questions to answer

### Why is this a good solution?

- What problem does it solve?
- What is one core feature of this product?
- How is it different from competitors?

### What are the finances?

- How much money is this product generating? Research using all available sources.
- What is its target audience?
- How big is the overall market?

### What is the reach?

- What channels are used to promote this product?
- What is the size of the social media or community following of the product or the authors?
- How much money do the creators spend on marketing?

### Implementation

- How is it built? What tech stack does it use? Be specific and make the best estimate based on research.
- What would be your team's "secret sauce," and what competencies would you need to add to your team?

## Optional extension task

If you finish early, pick one solution that your team would definitely *not* invest in. Use the questions above to justify your answer.
