# Vigo Case Study

## Scenario

Vigo is a clinically validated, at-home digital stroke rehabilitation platform co-designed with clinicians and built for long-term patient engagement. The product has successfully treated over 250 patients in Latvia, some for up to four years—with positive feedback from patients, clinicians, and rehabilitation institutions.

In 2022-2023 the company explored the US market. The core product - digital therapy tool - is MDR Class I medical device in the EU. The program consists of two parts: a patient-facing therapy delivery app and a clinician-facing patient management platform. It includes 300+ exercises.

Early clinical validation (~10 patients over 2–3 months) reported +36.8% improvement in performance satisfaction and +33.5% in performance skill self-assessments; the study was paused due to lack of funding.

## The Challenge

Despite strong clinical benefits and a solid local reputation with government agencies, rehab centers and patients, progress is constrained by a complex ecosystem with many stakeholders - users (patients and families), decision-makers (clinics/therapists), and payers (government/insurers).

The team decides to pivot. Because of the extensive exercise library, the potential is vast, including creating a defense related digital rehab tool for war injuries, a group fitness app for seniors, or therapy tool for dementia or Alzheimer's patients, just to name a few.

## The Task

* **Come up with a single market pivot** that will get the startup paid bigger sums and faster. Explain your reasoning and strategy in detail
* **Come up with a detailed strategy** to raise the next 100k EUR in funding. Some options include grants, angels, strategic partners
