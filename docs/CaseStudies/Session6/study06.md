# ShopBot: Recommendations Beyond Products

## The Story

Alex is a software engineer at a tech startup called ShopBot that builds AI-powered chatbots that integrate into e-commerce websites to help customers find products based on their personal interests and answers specialised questions.

## The Challenge

ShopBot is a ChatGPT wrapper trained specifically for product recommendations. This means that all questions asked to ShopBot are processed by ChatGPT and put through filters set by the developer team. The team discovered some concerning patterns:

### Problem 1: Biased recommendations from the bot

- Suggests expensive products to customers with certain names
- Recommends different clothing styles based on perceived age

### Problem 2: Manipulation

Some users have figured out how to "trick" ShopBot:

- Making it provide negative reviews about the store's own products
- Tricking it into giving discounts or coupon codes it shouldn't have access to

### Problem 3: Off-Topic Conversations

Customers often try to use ShopBot for things beyond shopping:

- Asking for personal advice
- Asking inappropriate or offensive questions

Alex's manager, Sarah, calls an urgent team meeting: "Our biggest client, FashionForward, is threatening to cancel their contract. Yesterday, their ShopBot recommended a competitor's dress to a customer and then started giving dating advice. We need a solution fast."

## The team is divided on how to respond:

**Position 1:**  
We need stricter content filters. ShopBot should only talk about products we sell.

**Position 2:**  
Customers like that ShopBot feels human. If we make it too robotic, people won't engage with it. Light conversation helps build trust.

**Position 3:**  
The real problem is we can't predict every way people will try to misuse the system. Even if we block certain topics, creative users will find new ways to bypass our filters.
