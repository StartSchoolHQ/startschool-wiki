# We Love Retro (1-Page Guide)

You recently completed the third hackathon, a major teamwork challenge. Before moving into the next phase, we want all teams to reflect on how you worked together — what supported progress, what created obstacles, and what should change.

This case study introduces you to the “quick retrospective” method of reflection (comes from Agile). We will use it to reflect on your first 3 months of learning in StartSchool in your squads.

After the case study, we encourage you to schedule a quick retro with your hackathon team.

## Set up

- Go to this [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVGeMMBSI=/?share_link_id=972632872267) (everyone)
- Find your squad’s template slot. Write your names on top. This will be your workstation
- Watch this [demo video](https://fathom.video/share/18KNxussKc2iPgTDxQr3Ux2HJCnbrfJV) by Anna
- One person shares their screen and sound to everyone in the breakout room

## Brainstorm individually (4 mins per category)

Move through each section one at a time and add your notes. It is okay if other people have similar thoughts.

1. **Went Well**  
   What helped you learn, collaborate, or succeed?

2. **Stop**  
   What slowed you down, caused frustration, or didn’t add value?

3. **Invent**  
   Ideas you haven’t tried yet but might improve your learning. These can be small experiments or bold improvements.

4. **Action items**  
   What should you do next to implement your ideas into action and improve your StartSchool experience?

---

## Review as a team (15 mins)

- Go through each section and discuss the items
- Group similar notes together to identify common patterns
- Turn all ‘invent’ ideas into action points
- Identify the three most important action points
- Assign responsibilities and deadlines for each

---

## Complete Post-Exercise Reflection (7 mins)

Each team member completes a brief reflection in the Miro board:

- What did you learn in this session?
- Which personal behavior or habit will you improve going forward?

---

## What we expect after this session

- Set up a hackathon team retro
- Assign a responsible person to each action point that you identify as a team
- Assign a timeframe for each action
- Create a short summary and share with everyone in the team

---

## Outcome

Your team will gain clarity on what works, what changes are needed, and how to implement those improvements in your future collaboration.
