## Debrief

**Edgars Peics, CTO at Fyul**

This is a great case study that highlights something we've worked hard to address at Fyul - transparency and fairness in compensation.

At Fyul, we use a strict leveling system for each position with in-depth requirement lists that clearly define what needs to be achieved for a salary promotion. This isn't just about internal promotions - we apply this same framework during our hiring process.

When we interview candidates like Anna, we assess their skills and experience against our level requirements through our interview process, which includes a technical interview. Based on their performance and demonstrated capabilities, we place them at the appropriate level. The salary offer is then based on that placement, and we explain the entire framework to them in detail during the offer stage. They can see exactly where they stand, what the next level looks like, and what's required to get there.

### Why do we do this?

One critical reason is to prevent situations where existing employees feel undervalued when new hires come in. If we hired Anna at a certain salary without this structure, our current team members at similar levels might wonder: "Why is she getting paid more than me for the same work?" or "Did I negotiate poorly when I joined?"

With our transparent leveling system, everyone - both new hires and current employees - can see that compensation is based on clearly defined criteria, not negotiation skills or timing. If Anna comes in at a Senior Level 2 with €2,800/month, everyone knows what that means and what she demonstrated in her technical interview to earn that placement.

### The key benefit

The key benefit of this system is clarity - it shows people exactly what they need to do to reach a higher salary. There's no guesswork or politics involved. Want to move from Level 2 to Level 3? Here's the specific list of technical skills, responsibilities, and outcomes you need to demonstrate. This creates a clear growth path for everyone.

### Advice for Anna

In Anna's situation, I'd encourage her to ask TechFlow about their leveling framework (if they have one). Understanding where this €2,600 sits in their structure would help her negotiate more effectively. Is this their starting senior salary? Is there room to place her higher based on her 5 years of experience and what she demonstrated in her interviews?

The transparency works both ways - it protects existing employees from feeling undervalued AND gives new candidates like Anna a clear path forward, not just a number that feels arbitrary.
