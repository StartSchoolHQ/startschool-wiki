## The story

Anna is a software engineer working at a large international IT services company in Riga. She has been working there for 3 years. The company recently changed their policy - everyone must work in the office 4 days a week instead of the previous 2 days.

Anna doesn't like this change. She is a single mother of a small child and enjoyed the flexibility of working from home. She also saves money on transport from a different city when working from home. Because of this policy change, she started looking for a new job.

Anna has 5 years of total work experience as a software engineer. She studied computer science and really enjoys programming, but work-life balance is very important to her.

Anna recently moved to a larger apartment and has higher rent now. She's also planning to buy a car next year because public transport with a small child is getting difficult.
