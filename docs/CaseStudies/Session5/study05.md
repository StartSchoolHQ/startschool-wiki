# Improved Ad Experience

## Scenario

Maya is a computer engineer working for an app that helps users keep track of medical information, doctor’s appointments, and prescriptions.

Information about the user is stored in this app, including what prescriptions they are taking and how frequently they schedule doctor’s appointments. As the developers of the app, the company has access to this information.  

During a company meeting, the marketing director shares a proposal to partner with pharmaceutical companies to serve targeted ads to users using anonymized data. Maya also learns that the app's current privacy policy includes broad language about "improving services and user experience" but doesn't specifically mention user data being sold.  

The next week, a colleague from the marketing department approaches Maya and requests her to supply customer-specific information to be used for ads. Maya understands that she is part of a company but is not fully comfortable with this idea. She knows that even "anonymized" data could potentially be re-identified when combined with other data that the app collects.

## Discussion Questions

1. How does Maya determine how much of the user’s information should be shared with marketing?  
2. If you were Maya, what would you do, and how would you approach the situation?  
3. Is this an ethical use of information?
