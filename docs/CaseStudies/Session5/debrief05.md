## Recommended Actions for Maya

Maya should take this request to the **project manager or direct supervisor**.  
As an engineer, she **doesn't have the authority** to approve cross-departmental data sharing, especially for sensitive medical information.  

The manager should then work with the **legal department** to determine:  
- What is legally permissible  
- What approvals are needed  

This approach **protects both Maya and the company** from potential liability and ensures that proper protocols are followed.

## Steps for Safeguarding Users as an Engineer

### Immediate Actions
- **Document concerns**: Write down specific issues with the data sharing plan.  
- **Research regulations**: Look into HIPAA, GDPR, and other relevant privacy laws.  
- **Talk to direct manager**: Express concerns professionally and ask for clarification on legal compliance.  

### If Internal Channels Fail
- Consider whether staying at the company aligns with personal ethics.  
- Consult with a lawyer about **whistleblower protections**.  
- Contact relevant **regulatory authorities** if laws are being broken.
