# Heatmap Dilemma

## Background

Congratulations! You’re a co-founder of Strava, a social fitness platform with millions of users worldwide

Your marketing team suggests publishing a global activity heatmap that aggregates all routes ever recorded on the app. The data visualization is stunning — it lights up the world's most popular running and cycling routes, from Central Park in New York to mountain trails in the Alps. Internal reviews suggest this could be a massive PR win.

## The Decision Point

The heatmap is ready to go live on your website. However, your Head of Engineering has just raised concerns: 

* Currently, user privacy settings allow profiles to be private, but all activity data still feeds into the heatmap
* In low-activity areas, routes of individual people might be identifiable

Your Head of Product counters that this is precisely what makes the visualization powerful - you see every place where a user has been

Your team must decide: Do you release the heatmap as planned, or hold back?

## Make a Team Decision (10 mins)

Tea also failed to remove metadata from uploaded images. Metadata includes:

* Risk Assessment: What is the worst-case scenario of this release? How likely is this scenario?
* Technical: What is the minimum density threshold (activities per area) that would prevent individual route identification? How would you implement this technically in a dataset with millions of entries? Do technical research
* Business: Currently, user privacy settings allow profiles to be private, but all activity data still feeds into the aggregate heatmap. How appropriate is it to post their anonymized data?

Make your decision now. Decide on who will present it to the rest of the group during a shared discussion
