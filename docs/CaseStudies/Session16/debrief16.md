# What Actually Happened

Strava released the heatmap to widespread acclaim
Downloads of the app spike 40% - everything the marketing team hoped for

Three weeks later, a user tweets a troubling observation: In remote areas of Afghanistan and Syria, the heatmap reveals detailed patterns of activity around unmarked locations—locations that correspond precisely with classified U.S. military bases.
Within hours, the tweet goes viral. Investigative journalists begin analyzing the heatmap, identifying:
* Internal layouts of secret military installations
* Supply route patterns in conflict zones

## The backlash is immediate and severe:
* The Pentagon issues a public statement expressing "serious concerns"
* Privacy advocates condemn your platform for endangering lives
* Users begin deleting their accounts
* Legislators call for hearings on data privacy in fitness apps
* Your stock price drops 23% in a single day

## The Crisis: Immediate Decisions Required

Your leadership team convenes an emergency meeting. The mood is tense. You need to make decisions—quickly—but also correctly

### Business
You need to release a public statement. Decide on:
* Tone and Accountability: Do you apologize? If so, for what specifically? Or do you frame this as an unintended consequence of data shared consensually by users?
* Immediate Actions: What immediate action do you announce? (Be specific)

### Technical
Design and specify technical features that would allow high-security clients (military personnel, intelligence officers, law enforcement, corporate executives, political figures, domestic violence survivors) to continue using Strava without risk
