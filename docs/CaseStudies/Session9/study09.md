# The Competing Solutions

## Scenario

Two teams are working on different solutions targeting university students

"StudyBuddy" – a platform where university students find study groups

"CampusEats" – food delivery app for university students 

Both teams are targeting university students

During lunch with Jen from "CampusEats", Marcus from "StudyBuddy" mentions: 

> "We've been getting great feedback! Reached out to Sarah Chen on LinkedIn - she built a successful student housing app - and she connected us to Dr. Rodriguez who works at SSE. We're interviewing their students next week."

Fast forward to the hackathon. During their presentation, "StudyBuddy" mention insights from their mentor Sarah Chen and student interviews. "CampusEats" presents right after. They also mention Sarah Chen and talk about interviews they conducted with students from the same university.

Marcus and his "StudyBuddy" teammates were left with an unpleasant aftertaste. Later on, they refrained from sharing their findings with peers from other teams. Jen's teammates from "CampusEats" feel awkward. No one says anything

## Discussion Questions

1. How would you feel if you were in either of the teams?
2. How can the teams move forward in a way that is best for them, the mentor, and the StartSchool community as a whole?
3. How does this situation relate to StartSchool's code of conduct?

## Bonus Question

A different scenario. You find out that someone took your idea from the __idea presentation__ and formed a team around it without you.

1. How would you feel and act in that situation?
