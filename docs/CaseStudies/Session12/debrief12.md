# How to run your retro (1-page guide)

Tech + business program — 3-month reflection  
Groups of 5–6 • One leader • Retro in Miro

## What this retro is for

A retrospective ("retro") helps your group look back on the last three months:
- What worked
- What should stop
- New ideas to try
- What actions you'll commit to next

Your Miro board is already prepared with all sections.

## 1. Start the retro

Leader (1–2 min):
- Welcome everyone
- Explain that the goal is honest, constructive reflection
- Turn on the Miro timer if helpful

## 2. Brainstorm (individually & silently)

Move through each section one at a time.  
Spend 3–4 minutes per category adding sticky notes.

### A. Went well
What helped you learn, collaborate, or succeed?  
→ Transition: Leader says, "Great. Next: What should we stop doing?"

### B. Stop
What slowed you down, caused frustration, or didn't add value?  
→ Transition: Leader says, "Now let's get creative with new ideas."

### C. Invent
Ideas you haven't tried yet but might improve your learning, teamwork, or structure.  
These can be small experiments or bold improvements.  
→ Transition: Leader says, "Let's turn our best ideas into action."

## 3. Discuss & cluster (5–8 min)

As a group, talk through the stickies and cluster similar ideas so patterns emerge.  
The leader helps guide the flow of conversation.

## 4. Turn 'invent' ideas into action points (5–8 min)

1. Review all invent ideas.
2. Choose 2–4 ideas your group wants to try next.
3. Move those sticky notes to action points.
4. Make each action concrete by defining:
   - What exactly will happen
   - Who is responsible
   - When you'll test or complete it

Action points should be specific, realistic, and doable.

## 5. Wrap-up (1 min)

The leader quickly recaps the agreed actions.  
Thank everyone and close the retro.

## Leader tips

- Keep the group moving through the stages.
- Make sure everyone speaks at least once.
- Stay neutral—your job is to guide, not decide.
