# Pitch Perfect

Time to learn what makes a good pitch great!

## Part 1: Analyze Two YC Pitches

Watch the following pitches: [**Doordash**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNAOXokK--o) & [**Goodybag**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScDKs8m3CdU) and answer these questions for each:

### Analysis questions

1. **Hook & Problem:** How clearly did they state the problem? Could a 10-year-old understand it?

2. **Solution & Demo:** Can you explain their product in one sentence after watching?

3. **Market & Traction:** How credible did the numbers feel for you as the audience?

4. **Effectiveness of numbers:** How effectively did the speakers use numbers to establish the problem's urgency? How about the effectiveness of their solution?

5. **Delivery & Structure:** What's the ONE thing that you remember most from this pitch?

## Part 2: Learn the Lesson

Pick [**one team**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12KJ_28LxahQuG3LInxM_z9TofgjxxVzC) from November's hackathon whose pitch you will analyze.
