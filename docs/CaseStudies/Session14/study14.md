# Pitch perfect - round #2

Learn what makes a great pitch stellar!  

## Part 1: Review a Pitch (15 mins)

Pick one team from January’s hackathon. Create a document for analysis of their pitch [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QGKT4LQ_RR23tjndaYENB9c_MnGr17hD?usp=drive_link). File name = [Startup project name - your names]


Watch the recording of this team’s pitch [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ffYOo8Z0nvLwjvK_0rn_TEgL107EIFaw/view?usp=drive_link). Write down your answers to the following questions. Be concise, **no AI slop**:

### Big Picture
- Can you explain what they do based on the pitch?  
- What emotion did you feel when watching this pitch? Excited? Confused? Bored?

### Delivery
- How well did the energy of the pitcher match the ambition of the idea?  
- What jargon needs replacing with plain English?  
- Any other recommendations

## Part 2: Do Better. Literally (20 mins)
Find the team’s [original pitch](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tYuTeKuEX-qN0Ojy4DHMN0sClQnH84qv?usp=drive_link) and add a copy in the [analysis folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QGKT4LQ_RR23tjndaYENB9c_MnGr17hD?usp=drive_link). Add a link to your copy of the presentation to your analysis document. File name = [Startup project name - your names]

Go through the slides. Make changes based on pitch [advice from Āris Brencis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qh1lsm2y_Tdgi7AawyGcKPLXuBW6VUXa/view?usp=drive_link)

- Remove everything that does not need to be there  
  - Create a clear and catchy first slide  
  - Improve readability. Think of contrast, font size, etc.  
  - Add or improve the visual identity  
  - Add any necessary diagrams  
  - Create a convincing team slide  
  - And other things  

## Part 3: Pitch!
